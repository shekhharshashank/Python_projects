Ranges
You can create a list of numbers automatically using a range. For example:

list(range(1, 10))

That will output:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

As you can see we just needed to specify the list boundaries inside range(). So, we specified 1and 10. Note that 10 is not included in the list. The generated list always runs up to one number before the upper number. In our example it goes up to 9 since the upper number is 10.

You can also specify a step as a third argument:

list(range(1, 10, 2))

That will output:

[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

So, the count happens every two items starting from 1 and ending at 9.


#tuples are mutable
Lists are Immuatable

Summary: Integers, Floats, Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, dir, help
In this section you learned that:

Integers are for representing whole numbers:

rank = 10
eggs = 12
people = 3
Floats represent continuous values:

temperature = 10.2
rainfall = 5.98
elevation = 1031.88
Strings represent any text:

message = "Welcome to our online shop!"
name = "John"
serial = "R001991981SW"
Lists represent arrays of values that may change during the course of the program:

members = ["Sim Soony", "Marry Roundknee", "Jack Corridor"]
pixel_values = [252, 251, 251, 253, 250, 248, 247]
Dictionaries represent pairs of keys and values:

phone_numbers = {"John Smith": "+37682929928", "Marry Simpons": "+423998200919"}
volcano_elevations = {"Glacier Peak": 3213.9, "Rainer": 4392.1}
Keys of a dictionary can be extracted with:

phone_numbers.keys()
Values of a dictionary can be extracted with:

phone_numbers.values()
Tuples represent arrays of values that are not to be changed during the course of the program:

vowels = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')
one_digits = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
To find out what attributes a type has:

dir(str)
dir(list)
dir(dict)
To find out what Python builtin functions there are:

dir(__builtins__)
Documentation for a Python command can be found with:

help(str)
help(str.replace)
help(dict.values)


Summary: Positive/Negative Indexes, Slicing
In this section you learned that:

Lists, strings, and tuples have a positive index system:

["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
   0      1      2      3      4      5      6
And a negative index system:

["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
  -7     -6     -5     -4     -3     -2     -1
In a list, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th items can be accessed with:

days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
days[1:4]
Output: ['Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu']
First three items of a list:

days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
days[:3]
Output:['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed'] 
Last three items of a list:

days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
days[-3:]
Output: ['Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']
Everything but the last:

days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
days[:-1] 
Output: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'] 
Everything but the last two:

days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
days[:-2] 
Output: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri'] 
A single in a dictionary can be accessed using its key:

phone_numbers = {"John Smith":"+37682929928","Marry Simpsons":"+423998200919"}
phone_numbers["Marry Simpsons"]
Output: '+423998200919'


Summary: Functions and Conditionals
In this section you learned to:

Define a function:

def cube_volume(a):
    return a * a * a
Write a conditional block:

message = "hello there"
 
if "hello" in message:
    print("hi")
else:
    print("I don't understand")
Write a conditional block of multiple conditions:

message = "hello there"
 
if "hello" in message:
    print("hi")
elif "hi" in message:
    print("hi")
elif "hey" in message:
    print("hi")
else:
    print("I don't understand")
Use the and operator to check if both conditions are True at the same time:

x = 1
y = 1
 
if x == 1 and y==1:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
Output is Yes since both x and y are 1.

Use the or operator to check if at least one condition is True:

x = 1
y = 2
 
if x == 1 or y==2:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
Output is Yes since x is 1.

Check if a value is of a certain type with:

isinstance("abc", str)
isinstance([1, 2, 3], list)
or

type("abc") == str
type([1, 2, 3]) == lst
